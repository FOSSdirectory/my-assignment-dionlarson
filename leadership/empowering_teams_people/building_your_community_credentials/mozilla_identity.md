# Your Mozilla Identity


* Q1. Where can I find you at Mozilla ?
* Q2. 
* When speaking technically in developer communities, how do you explain your experience?  Accomplishments? Goals and ambitions?
* Q3. Where do you go to learn?  
* Q4. If someone in the Mozilla or developer communites has a concern, or feedback that impacts the project who do you know that will respond and what would you expect?


What sorts of things do I take for granted as a Mozilla technical leader?

How are my experiences different from those of a disadvantaged group?

Why do these differences matter? What do they look like in the real world?
