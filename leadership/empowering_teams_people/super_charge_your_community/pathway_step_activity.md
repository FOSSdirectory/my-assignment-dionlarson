In the same pairs, ask participants take one of their emerging and important personas and interview each other with the following questions.

## Visualizing Participation Steps  

**Format:** Partner A will interview Partner B, and have one minute per question. Then Partner B will interview Partner A on the same question. Faciltator times. Ask the interviewing particpants to take notes as before, on important themes, ideas and even hunches - on sticky notes.

* **Q1**  Tell the story of how one of your personas came or might come your project?
* **Q2**  What is the smallest unit of contribution for this contributor?
* **Q3**  How does this contributor know they are successful and where to go next?
* **Q4**  How might this contributor help others starting after them?
* **Q5** What barriers might they encounter

**Mapping**:  

Ask each pair will map their findings along a pathway or progression by asking themselves the question, and biulding out the steps: 

> How might we bring our persona, as they arrive in our community 3 steps closer to the potenial of their participation which is _______ ?

Provide partners with [step templates](assets/steptemplate.pdf), and explain each attribute.

* **Value to contributor**: what opportunity exists for this person if they complete a step?  Examples might be learn a skill, recieve mentorship, perhaps their name will be mentioned in a public post (encourage empathy we've built to respond here) , 
* **Value to project**: What benefits the project by someone successfully completing this step?
* **What needs to be in place**: What needs to be in place for success of this step?  This can be anything from mentors, to accounts for people on tools, and even prequisite knowledge.
* **How someone knows they are successful** Don't assume, contributors know - what clarity will be built in to trigger recognition of success.
* **Action Items**: What actions does this person need to take within this step?  Might be login to Bugzilla, assign a task to themselves, introduce themselves on a forum etc.
