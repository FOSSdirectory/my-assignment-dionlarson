Provide partners with [step templates](assets/steptemplate.pdf), and explain each attribute.

* **Prerequiste** What should this person know or do before starting this pathway?

* **Value to project**: What benefits the project by someone successfully completing this step?
* **What needs to be in place**: What needs to be in place for success of this step?  This can be anything from mentors, to accounts for people on tools, and even prequisite knowledge.
* **How someone knows they are successful** Don't assume, contributors know - what clarity will be built in to trigger recognition of success.
* **Action Items**: What actions does this person need to take within this step?  Might be login to Bugzilla, assign a task to themselves, introduce themselves on a forum etc. 
* * **Next Steps** What step comes next, or could come next?
