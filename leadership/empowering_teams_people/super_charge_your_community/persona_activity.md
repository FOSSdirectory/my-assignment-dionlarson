Partner participants in pairs based on similarity of interests, background or knowledge.   Assuming this is known, otherwise use a round of introductions to bring out themes: 

 >“Hi my name is ______ and my community goal is”. 
 
Ask participants to self-organize into pairs based on what resonated with them about someone else’s goal or project. 

## Persona Interviews

The goal of these interviews is to recognize  of the Personas in shared communities, and to gain empathy for their experience.  For each of these questions 

**Format:** Partner A will interview Partner B, and have one minute per question. Then Partner B will interview Partner A on the same question. Faciltator times. Ask participants to record as many important themes, ideas, and things of interest as they can on sticky notes.

People will feel rushed, but that's OK - this is a creative process, encourage them to surface what feels important, and meaningful, but also to share inklings of ideas, and hunches as well.

* **Q1** Who is in your community? How would you describe the range of people in your community?
* **Q2** What kind of person do you most need in your community right now, in a year from now?
* **Q3** Imagine: what does that person get excited about, and why? What might they find challenging or discouraging, and why?
* **Q4** Who have you lost or are missing, and why do you think that person left the community?

**Categorize**

Ask partners to spend 4 minutes categerizing their notes under the following categories:

* Skills
* Motivation
* Challanges
* Attitudes
* Need

*Note: Facilitators should prepare these categories via sticky note headers for Particpants ahead of time.

These are our emerging Personas.  Give teams another 4 minutes to find one or two Personas and to document them using this template.
