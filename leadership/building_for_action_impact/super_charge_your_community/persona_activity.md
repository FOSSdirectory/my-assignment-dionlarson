## Persona Design

Partner participants in pairs based on similarity of interests, background or knowledge.   Assuming this is known, otherwise use a round of introductions to bring out themes: 

 >“Hi my name is ______ and my community goal is”. 
 
Ask participants to self-organize into pairs based on what resonated with them about someone else’s goal or project. 

**Note**: Let people know the next activities will be timed. People will feel rushed, but that's OK - this is a creative process, encourage them to surface what feels important, and meaningful, but also to share inklings of ideas, and hunches as well.  

## Persona Interviews (8 minutes)

The goal of these interviews is to recognize similar personalities, amibitions, motivations and skills between communities - to gain empathy for why people turn up, and where they hope to go.  For each of these questions 

**Format:** *Partner A will interview Partner B*, and have one minute per question. Then *Partner B will interview Partner A* on the same question. Ask participants to record as many important themes, ideas, and things of interest as they can on sticky notes.

* **Q1** Who is in your community? How would you describe the range of people in your community?
* **Q2** What kind of person do you most need in your community right now, in a year from now?
* **Q3** Imagine: what does that person get excited about, and why? What might they find challenging or discouraging, and why?
* **Q4** Who have you lost or are missing, and why do you think that person left the community?

### Categorize ( 5 minutes )

**Categorize**
Ask partners to spend 5 minutes categerizing their notes under the following categories:

* Skills
* Motivation
* Challanges
* Attitudes
* Need

Ask them to identify one strong Persona emerging from the excercise, to give them a name, age, location, 'sense of belonging', and profession.  [They can use this template]().  We will use our Persona names moving forward.
