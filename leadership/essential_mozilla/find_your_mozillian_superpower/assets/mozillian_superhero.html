        My superhero name is ________________________________ and
        I __________ recognize that  _____________(part of the Manifesto) most speaks to me.
        I am bound to protect and bring forward the citizens of the web in the best way I know how,
        which is my unique ability to ______________________________________________ .
        This brings me closer to my overall personal goal of ______________________


        It's true that dedicating myself in this way may limited my ability to _____________________.
        but I know that will be in good hands with the super heroes there.
