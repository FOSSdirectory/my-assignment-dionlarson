#Screening Applicants

One of the most important tasks of the Mentor is to review new applicants to the Mozilla Reps program.  Before an applicant is assigned to a mentor, the Reps Community Manager has already completed initial screening.  For example applicants **must** have a Mozillians account, and have activity for 6 months prior to being assigned to a mentor.  

#Steps

Rep applicants are often very enthusiastic about the process, and will be excited to hear from you.  To encourage positivity, mentors are encouraged to complete the screening steps within 7 days of being assigned.  

**Note**: In the past we had a 'no brainer' acceptance (no interview), but this has since been removed.  The interview is an important piece of communication, and helps establish your relationship from the beginning.

There are five distinct steps for screening

* Step 1: [Initial Screening](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Mentoring/Screening#Step_1:_Initial_screening)
* Step 2: [Assessmentt](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Mentoring/Screening#Step_2:_Assessment) 
* Step 3: [Intervieww](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Mentoring/Screening#Step_3:_Interviewing_the_applicant) 
* Step 4: [Decision Communicationn](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Mentoring/Screening#Step_4:_Communicating_Your_Decision) 
* Step 5: [Formal Acceptance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Mentoring/Screening#Formally_accepting_the_applicant_into_the_program) 
* Step 6: [Orientation Period](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mentor_Orientation_Call) 

# Discussion

Please take time to review each of these steps above, and answer the following questions:

1. [If an applicant is *not* ready, what follow-up activities will you suggest?](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/mentor-training-update/1722/2?u=emma_irwin)
2. What questions seem most important to you, in deciding whether someone is ready or not?
3. How would you explain the Reps program to someone who has applied thinking Reps is a form of recognition, or level of contributor status?
4. What is the maximum amount of time you should wait for an applicant to complete the process before closing the bug as 'RESOLVED / WONTFIX' ?
5. What follow-up suggestions would you have for an applicant who 'isn't ready?
6. Why is the orientation call so important?
