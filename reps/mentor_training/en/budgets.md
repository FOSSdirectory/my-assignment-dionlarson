The Reps program has a budget available for disbursement to those Reps who want to run events, or initiatives but require financial assistance to be successful.  This is a form of empowered contribution offered by the Reps program, and as a mentor your role is key on helping Reps define, organize and submit budgets for approval.  

## A Common Concern

Before we get started, I want to share this commonly communicated concern :
  ___

> I don't understand why my budget is being questioned so much, I've run lots of successful events in the past!  

  ___

  It's understandable that as passionate and successful volunteers, we can feel sensitive when our budgets are questioned, and so it's super important to communicate, that **reviews are not personal, because they're not.**.

> Reps is a project made of people, of leaders, whose actions can have incredible impact on Mozilla mission. A budget review is not about trust, it's not about reputation, it's about ensuring a quality of impact on Mozilla's missionm and spreading our spending among as many activities as possible.

Think of it in terms of a Firefox code reviews. No developer by-passes the QA process for submitting code, new code goes through *the same exact* steps every time - to protect the quality and impact of the project.  
Budget Review = Code Review.  

> Or simply think of how you treat your own money, our attitudes should be no different.

# Budget Basics!

One of THE most helpful, meaningful, awesome, impact-ful, productive, WONDERFUL things you can do for the program is to not only review budgets, but help Reps understand best practices of the process. Here are some high-level suggestions for making council's work easier, and budgets more likely to pass through without challange:

* Ask questions about metrics if you don't understand them, or if seem overly optimistic for an event. Suggest metrics your mentee may not have considered.
* If Reps have hosted similar events, ask them to evaluate (with you) ways to improve with new events based on their experiences (blog posts and metrics) of the past.
* Encourage Reps to seek donation of space, partnership for catering and any other inventive methods of saving money they can come up with.
* Discourage travel where unnecessary
* Ensure events have detailed agendas
* Watch over-bloating of catering or printing, and make suggestions for cutting back.

#The Ins and Outs of the Budget Process

Budgets can be hard, they can take time -  but we get better at with practice and by understanding and helping each other. The result feels a lot like the top picture of Rep Karoke :)
