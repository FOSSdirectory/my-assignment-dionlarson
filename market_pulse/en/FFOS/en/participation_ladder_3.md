The next set of tasks, are complimentary to the critical, monthly data research, and something to important to improving the vision of your local market for Mozilla. Ths next set of tasks is sometimes called ['Qualitative Data'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research)

> Qualitative research is about discovering not only what people think, but why they think it. It's another level of detective work, getting people to share their thoughts and opinions as a way to better understand their motivation.

This type of research can be done in a number of places, and with a diverse set of people, some suggestions are:
* Staff working in retail stores seeling FFOS phones
* Customers with new FFOS phones
* Friends, family and community members who have purchased FFOS phones
* Friends, family and community members who have purchased competititor phones
* {OTHER ?}
Questions you can ask really depend on the person you are interviewing and what you hope they can tell you. Here are some suggestions!
* How many people have purchased this phone in your store in the recent month?
* What do you find is the most compelling reason people select FFOS Phone?
* What do you think is the biggest reason people do not chose FFOS Phone?
* What do you love about your FFOS phone?
* What do you prefer about your competitor phone?
* If you could have one improvement to your phone (FFOS or competitor) what would it be?

## How we report this data
TODO: Web App  - leveraging the comment section

## When we report this data
TODO: What is the best practice, how often - how many people do we interview?
## Tech Events
We don't only want to report-local data, we want to turn up in person and engage your local community through tech events. Your opinion + the opinions of your local community matter most to this decision.

TODO: Will we provide a list of local tech events? What kind of information matters most to you when seleting tech events?
#Discussion
Please respond to the following questions on Discourse, and then read the responses of others.
1. List five people in your area who you could collect qualitative research from?
2. Give some examples of questions you think would help share the story of your local mobile market? (we will use these to help improve the question database)
3. TODO: Other questions that might help not only get participants thinking - but provide you with better questions to ask.
