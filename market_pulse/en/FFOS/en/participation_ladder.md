# Marketpulse Participation Ladder


There are three levels of participation, ranging from our first set of most critical research needs, leading into deeper evaluations of market through storytelling, and outreach.  Each of these priorities have their own training module, and each will be released as an 'activity' in coming months.  Currently we are focused on the first activity:  [Firefox OS Data Collector](http://education.mozilla-community.org/modules/market_pulse/participation_ladder_1)
