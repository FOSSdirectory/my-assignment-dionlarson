#Marketpulse Price Collection Fields & How to Use Them!


Below is a list of the fields associated with Firefox OS and Competitor data collection, their intended use and best practices.

#### Store Name

Full store name, no abbreviations.

#### Online Store (yes/no)

Indicates whether or not this price is being recorded from an online store. 

#### Store Location

Using Open Street Map & your device location will record the store's location.

#### Device - Is this a Firefox OS Device? (yes/no)

This is an important Toggle.  Firefox OS phone is selected by default.

1.  If you are collecting information for Firefox OS, leave the toggle selected. Select the phone manufacturer from the provided drop-down list.

2.  If you are collecting information for a competitor phone, then change this switch to no or 'off' position.  Enter the Device Manufacturer, and Device Model in the text boxes below. Do not abbreviate the names of either.

#### In Stock (yes/no)

Whether or not a phone is currently in stock.

'Out of Stock', will generally be a verbal confirmation from store owners, and may be recorded as true or false in the web app.   It would be valuable to add in the comments section whether the phone is temporarily or permanently out of stock.

#### Price - Is this price part of a plan?

You can record one or more prices for the same phone, as a phone may be priced individually or as part of one or more 'package' offerings.  The default is set to 'no'.

1. If the price you are recording is for the phone only, then stay with the default and enter the price.
2. If the price you are recording is for a package that includes this same phone, toggle to yes.
 * Select a carrier from the list provided.
 * Enter the monthly fee
 * Enter the plan description.  Be as clear as possible about what is included.
 * Enter the plan duration in months.

#### Comments

Adding meaningful comments for prices-collected will go a long way to help the Market Pulse team understand the pricing of phones in your region. Some suggestions for topics are:

* Positioning of Firefox OS phones in the store.
* Whether or not a phone price is 'sale'.
* Advertising (inside or outside) the store for Firefox OS.
* Comments from store clerks about people who have purchased Firefox OS.
* Feedback from store clerks about why people (in their opinion) do, or do not select Firefox OS.
* Something you notice that seems interesting, odd or compelling.
* A hunch, theory or insight into why something is the way it is.
* If the store seems to be putting emphasis on any one phone device (ie: wearing t-shirts, giving away swag for a specific model)
