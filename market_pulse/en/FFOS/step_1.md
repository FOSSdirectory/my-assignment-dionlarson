On this, the first step of Marketpulse, you will learn basic skills and strategies of Market Research, while providing valuable data on Firefox OS in your local market.

### Welcome!

Most critical for the short-term success of Firefox OS Market Research, and our Market Research  Team is the collection of local pricing for Firefox OS. **The [Marketpulse Web App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community/)** will make it easy to collect Firefox OS data for:

* Web Stores
* Local Stores

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x pull-left"></i> Note: This step focuses on data collection in: Brazil, Mexico, India, Bangladesh, Philippines, Russia and Colombia. [For detail on design and outcomes of this step, please visit the wiki.](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation/Ladders/Marketpulse/Steps/FFOS_Data_Collection#Marketpulse_Participation_Step_-_Firefox_OS_Research)

### Introduction & App Tutorial

In this video, we do a brief tour of the resources available to help your success recording Firefox OS phone data, as well as a demo of the Web App itself. Scroll down to find a list of other resources available including a printable checklist, and Marketpulse app glossary.

*The 'comment' field is perhaps the most important in capturing the 'picture' of your local market and the data you're collecting! Document your observations, but also your suspicions, opinion and ideas!  It's impossible to provide 'too much information'!*


### Monthly Reporting Builds Skill & Helps Mozilla!

Monthly reportingcan help grow your confidence, help you identify patters in your local market, and improve the quality of data overall.  


#### Or sooner if...

A price changes, or new offer appears within the same month, you are encouraged to report this change as a new price. Again, the comments section helps explain to Market Pulse what prompted your entry.
