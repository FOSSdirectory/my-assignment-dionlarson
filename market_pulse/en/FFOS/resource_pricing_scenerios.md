The Market Pulse Web App will allow you to collect multiple prices for different price scenarios, and for multiple device-types.  

### In Stock

This may seem obvious, but the store display may only represent a portion of whats actually in stock. 
For the best information, ask the store clerk about their Firefox OS phones in their store. A good question to ask might be:

> "What Firefox OS devices to you have in stock ?"

and perhaps

> "Which of those, are on display?"

### Out of Stock

Another important question, even if the store currently carrying one or more Firefox OS phones is:

> "Are there any Firefox OS devices you normally carry, that are not currently in stock?"

And finally  - if there are devices not in stock:

> "Will you be getting new stock?"

#### Not Returning

If you find a phone 'out of stock', and the store clerk has indicated they will not be getting new stock in - then please indicate this in the comments and with a phone price of 0

### Regular Price

The 'regular price' of a phone, is simply the cost of a phone for purchase. This is different, of course, from phones on sale, or sold as part of a plan.  When you record this price, you will indicate that this phone is NOT part of a plan.

### As Part of a Plan

Stores usually sell phones individually (regular price), or part of a plan with things like data, or other incentives like Lego and data plans.  When you record this price in the Web App, you will indicate that this phone IS part of a plan.   Also, please add in comments exactly what items comes with the plan is very important.

### On Sale

Regular priced phones, that are not part of a plan with a reduced price are 'on Sale'.  There is no specific data-entry for sale prices, so it's super important to indicate in the 'comments' section if this phone price is indicated as 'On Sale'.
