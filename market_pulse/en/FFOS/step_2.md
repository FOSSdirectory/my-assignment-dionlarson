On this, the second step of Marketpulse, you'll leverage and build on the Market Research skill-set you started building by collecting Firefox OS data in [step 1](/modules/marketpulse_activities/step_1/).

### Welcome Back!

In this series of videos you'll be taken through the workflow of collecting phone prices, how you can manage your contributions, collaborate with community and share the story of your local market through photos. It's important that you watch the training video in Step 1 before beginning this new series.

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x pull-left"></i> If you find any issues/bugs in the [Marketpulse App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community/activities/) please file a [report here](https://github.com/mozilla/marketpulse/issues).

### Competitor Phone Data Collection 

In the new version of Marketpulse, we've added the ability to collect competitor phone data and improved the screen to allow multiple price scenarios. This video steps through the process of collecting data, as well as some best practices in effective reporting.

### Managing your contributions!

The data you collect tells the story of you, and your local market.  Markpulse now allows you to edit, delete and clone your contributions. Enrich your reporting by updating entries 'on the go' or at home.

### Community Collaboration & Telling Stories with Media

Sometimes a pictures does say 'a thousand words'. Photos can help complete and perfect your market research.  Photos, of course, can be screen-grabs, and images taken of store interior, exterior and phone displays.  Photos can also capture feeling, energy and subtle things not easily expressed in words.  

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x pull-left"></i>  Make sure you have people's permission before you take their photo.

4. I have a lot of ideas about the types of things I should add in the comments box.
