# First-Level Activity : Firefox OS Device Price Collection

![webapp](http://tiptoes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-28_1308.png)

Most critical for the short-term success of Firefox OS Market Research, and our Market Research Impact Team is the collection of local pricing for Firefox OS. The [Market Pulse Web App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community/) web app will make it easy to collect Firefox OS data for:

* Web Stores
* Local Stores

---

## Web App

We'll be using the [Market Pulse Web App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community) to record data. It will also help you track activities and contributions over time.  For this first activity we'll be collecting the following information:

#### Store Name
Full store name, no abbreviations.

#### Online Store (yes/no)
Indicates whether or not this price is being recorded from an online store.  

#### Store Location
Using Open Street Map & your device location will record the store's location.

#### Device Type
Phone device brand, selected from an a list.

#### Whether or not the phone is in stock

This is a verbal confirmation from store owners, and may be recorded as true or false in the web app.  See 'Pricing Scenarios' below for more on this data.

#### Price 
The price of the device.

Currency#### 
Currency of the reported price.

#### Comments 
A very important part of data collection are all those observations that occur to you as you record information. We cannot stress enough, how important it is to the project outcome - that you share as as many observations as possible.

## Pricing Scenarios

![pricingscenerios](http://tiptoes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sale-tags1.png)

The Market Pulse Web App will allow you to collect multiple prices for different price scenarios, and for multiple device-types.  

### In Stock

This may seem obvious, but the store display may only represent a portion of whats actually in stock. 
For the best information, ask the store clerk about their Firefox OS phones in their store. A good question to ask might be:

> "What Firefox OS devices to you have in stock ?"

and perhaps

> "Which of those, are on display?"

### Out of Stock

Another important question, even if the store currently carrying one or more Firefox OS phones is:

> "Are there any Firefox OS devices you normally carry, that are not currently in stock?"

And finally  - if there are devices not in stock:

> "Will you be getting new stock?"

#### Not Returning

If you find a phone 'out of stock', and the store clerk has indicated they will not be getting new stock in - then please indicate this in the comments and with a phone price of 0

### Regular Price

The 'regular price' of a phone, is simply the cost of a phone for purchase. This is different, of course, from phones on sale, or sold as part of a plan.  When you record this price, you will indicate that this phone is NOT part of a plan.

### As Part of a Plan 

![package](http://tiptoes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-01_1751.png)

Stores usually sell phones individually (regular price), or part of a plan with things like data, or other incentives like Lego and data plans.  When you record this price in the Web App, you will indicate that this phone IS part of a plan.   Also, please add in comments exactly what items comes with the plan is very important.

### On Sale

Regular priced phones, that are not part of a plan with a reduced price are 'on Sale'.  There is no specific data-entry for sale prices, so it's super important to indicate in the 'comments' section if this phone price is indicated as 'On Sale'.  


## Comments

Adding meaningful comments for prices-collected will go a long way to help the Market Pulse team understand the pricing of phones in your region.   Some suggestions for topics are:

* Positioning of Firefox OS phones in the store.
* Whether or not a phone price is 'sale'.
* Advertising (inside or outside) the store for Firefox OS.
* Comments from store clerks about people who have purchased Firefox OS.
* Feedback from store clerks about why people (in their opinion) do, or do not select Firefox OS.

## Contribution Tally.

Currently the Web App displays the following information on the home screen:

* How many submissions you have made with the Web App.  
* The overall percentage your contributions represent of all contributions.

We hope this is a fun way to track your progress, but we welcome your feedback on meaningful ways to show both individual and team progress.

## Collection Scenarios

![datacollection](http://tiptoes.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8016173775_3299f6b838_m.jpg)

### Once Per Month

Collection of phone prices needs to be done once per month.  Reporting the same phone price in the same month is discouraged. 

### Exception

If a price changes, or new offer appears within the month, you are encouraged to report this change as a new price. Again, the comments section helps explain to Market Pulse what prompted your entry.

**NOTE: If you find you are without connectivity, or have issues with collecting data on your phone, it's a good idea to bring a notebook and pencil as backup.  This way you can enter data at a later time.

Here are some questions to help you evaluate your readiness to begin. If you find yourself answering 'no' or 'maybe' to a majority of these questions, please reach out to us and we will help you. 

1.  I feel confident in my knowledge of how to navigate the Marketpulse Web App User Interface.  
2.  I understand the difference between pricing for a phone, and phones that come as part of a plan.
3.  I understand how 'contributions' are recorded and calculated on the Web App.
4.  I know how often reporting should be done for a single price, and what the exception is to that rule.
5.  I know that 'Out of Stock' has two distinct meanings, and how to report those differences using the 'Comments' field in the Web App.
6.  I am clear on the milestones associated with reward and recognition.
7.  I know how to suggestion improvements for this educational content based on my experiences.
