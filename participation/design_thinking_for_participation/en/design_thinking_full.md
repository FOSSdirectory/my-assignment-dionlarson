This facilitation strategy for 'Human Centered Design for Participation is preceded by the [Workshop Outline](modules/participation_design_thinking/workshop/ )', and recommended for scenarios #1, #2, #4 .

## Reinforce Outcome

Before starting the full d.school course, reinforce the outcomes you're after:

* Success is coming out of this understanding what the key problem is that I (or my team) want to solve for.
* Success is having some early prototypes and ideas we're interested in testing or adopting into existing processes and experiments.
* A list of one or more action items, whatever those first steps towards experimentation might be.  

**Ask if anyone has questions.**

## Begin!

With the 'Focus Statement' clearly articulated, it's time to get started.  Ask people to pair up, if there is hesitation then pair people in the way you think most makes sense from your observations. Hand out the D-School worksheet(which you [prepared](modules/participation_design_thinking/workshop_preparation/) in the preferred language prior to the workshop).

Following the directions on the [d.school design sheet](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Participant-Worksheet.pdf) to bring your group to a final problem statement and prototype. **Run this course in it's entirety.**

### Building and Documenting Consensus

Once you've finished the Design Thinking facilitation it's time to bring the group's ideas into center.

As a group ask people who feel they have a prototype to share (it doesn't have to be everyone).  As they share (on a whiteboard or flip chart so people can make suggestions), make notes on:

1. **Problem Statement(s)**
   Start with 1, which may be refined by the group as they continued to share.  If problem statements differ wildly, then just make a list.
2. **Themes/Trends** This could be anything: education, diversity, communication.
3. **Context** What do you need to know about the background? What are the key facts?
4. **Opportunities** These could be recognition of entities, people or existing activities that can add benefit quickly.
5. **Challenges**  Identified challenges like time, resources, empowerment. Real issues, not imagined or bias from experience.
6. **Dependencies**
