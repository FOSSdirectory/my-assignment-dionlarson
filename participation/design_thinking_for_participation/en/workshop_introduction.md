## Workshop Background & Introduction

This resource provides content, tools and facilitation techniques needed to run a **'Participation at Mozilla' Design Thinking Workshop**.  The accompanying workshop can help teams and contributors create empathetic problem statements and strong hypothesis for solving Participation problems through rapid prototyping.

This workshop process will equip participants with a new set of skills, leading to better quality experiments and ultimately improved strategic success on Mozilla's mission and project goals. 

We borrow heavily from [d-school's Crash Course in Design Thinking](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/) which is available under Creative Commons ([CC BY-NC 3.0Licence](CC BY-NC 3.0Licence)).
