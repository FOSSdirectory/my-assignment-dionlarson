## Workshop Background & Introduction

This resource provides content, tools and facilitation techniques needed to run a **'Participation at Mozilla' Design Thinking Workshop**. This workshop will help teams and contributors create empathetic problem statements and strong hypothesis for solving those problems through rapid prototyping. This process will equip participants with a new set of skills resulting in better quality experiments and ultimately improved strategic success on Mozilla's mission and project goals. 

This workshop borrows heavily from [d-school's Crash Course in Design Thinking](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/) which is available under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC 3.0Licence). Working with human centered design guides our processes with empathy at the center of all we do. We believe that through collaboration, and by involving diverse perspectives while continually prototyping we move closer to better outcomes for Mozilla and volunteers.

The emphasis of this workshop is to increase the **participants awareness of the possible, probable and desirable futures for Participation**, to emerge with an attitude of 'prototyping in all we do' as well as an appreciation of key forces influencing the change we need.  

### Who should take this workshop?

Learning how to run creative, strategic and insightful workshops with outcomes in the vision of a virtuous circle is relevant to:

* Project leads 
* Regional community leaders
* Core contributors
* Those invested in community or open education initiatives at Mozilla.
* Decision-makers across the project

Self-identifying as a ‘Participation Expert’ is not a major criteria for running this workshop, but we suggest the following:

#### Should have
* Understanding of Design Thinking (you have minimally, taken the 90 minute [Design Thinking Crash Course](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/)), or have been a participant in this workshop previously.
* Some experience either working at Mozilla with volunteers, or volunteering at Mozilla or another open project.
* A belief that Participation provides strategic advantage to Mozilla, and lets us “punch above our weight”.
* Understanding of regional community dynamics.
* Invested interest in helping people.
* Comfort public speaking and/or teaching.  
* An interest in building better experiences for volunteers at Mozilla.
* An interest in helping project teams at Mozilla reach their Participation goals.
* A minimum of one Open Source T-Shirt (kidding, kidding).

#### Nice to Have

* Clear understanding and background working in the open.
* Experience participating in open source communities other than Mozilla.
* Experience managing volunteer, or volunteer communities in any capacity.
* A personal interest in professional development that improves your skills in facilitation and teaching (open to feedback basically).
* An interest in helping improve this workshop through either pull requests, or ‘issues’.
