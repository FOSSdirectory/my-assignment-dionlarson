##Preparing for Success

There are some key decisions and preparation work you should cover before running this workshop.

### Inviting People
[We’ve covered who this workshop can benefit](/modules/participation_design_thinking/workshop-introduction/), but who else should you invite?  

The answer is **anyone working on, or near Participation at Mozilla**: volunteers, staff of any confidence level, experience or curiosity.  **The more voices the better, the greater diversity - the better.**

### Research

You’re not expected to be the primary holder of all knowledge and wisdom in a given topic-area, or even an expert in Participation, but you do need to do your homework before you show up.  If you don't already: learn about the functional area, or main topic of focus for Participation.  

* Read and document Wiki Pages web pages
* Check out mailing lists and forums to grasp the current status and health of Participation. 
* Reach out to contributors who might be interested in sharing stories or insight into what it means to contribute to that particular part of the project.  
* Check out the [Marketpulse course ‘Interviewing Users for Mozilla’](http://education.mozilla-community.org/modules/marketpulse_activities/step_3/) to learn valuable skills in listening and note-taking.

### Materials
* [Print Design Thinking Worksheet](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Participant-Worksheet.pdf) . It’s available in a [few languages](https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/31fbd/NonEnglishLanguage_Assets.html).  You may only need the first sheet depending on the [focus you choose](/modules/participation_design_thinking/workshop/).
* Bring colorful markers or crayons so when people engage in solutions they feel they are in a creative environment.
* Bring sticky notes, should you not have access to a large writing space, but usually these are good to have.
* Whiteboard or Flip-Chart to record notes and group observations.
