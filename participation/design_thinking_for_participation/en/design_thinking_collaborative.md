This facilitation strategy for 'Human Centered Design for Participation is preceded by the [Workshop Outline](modules/participation_design_thinking/workshop/ )', and recommended for scenario #5.

The scope of focus can be related to functional areas (FFOS, Webmaker), function (code, QA, public speaking), or  skillset (Front-End development, Market Research) but the emphasis is on this opportunity for staff and volunteers to **gain empathy for each other as a route to truly innovative Participation solutions**.

## Reinforce Outcome

Before starting the full d.school course, reinforce the outcomes you're after:

* Success is coming out of this understanding what the key problem is that I (or my team) want to solve for.
* Success is having some early prototypes and ideas we're interested in testing or adopting into existing processes and experiments.
* A list of one or more action items, whatever those first steps towards experimentation might be.

## Begin!

Position yourself at the front of the room with a Whiteboard or Flip-Chart dedicated to capturing the conversation you're about to have.  Create columns for the following:

* Needs
* Wants
* Barriers
* Opportunities
* Ideas

1. Ask everyone to **self-identify as either a staff member or volunteer**. For those who wear multiple hats, ask them to choose just one perspective they feel is most valuable.
2. **Ask for a representative from each group** to act as 'spokesperson'.  This person will be responsible for asking interview questions of the other group.
3. Run the d.school steps 1 and 2 with each representative asking Interview questions of the other group.

**Tip** When you take notes, there's no need to 'separate voices' the voices by staff or volunteer.  All context is relevant as Participation feedback.

## Build a Problem-Statement Together

Once you've finished the interview process, it's time to bring the group's ideas into center, and to iterate on a problem statement.

Ask key stakeholders, and others to weigh in on what they heard and together create a problem statement.  Set yourself no more than 10  minutes for this discussion.  

**Tip:** You might want to create two primary problem statements, one for volunteers and one for staff (if it makes sense to do so)

**Tip:**If people get off track, or insist on emphasis that's out of scope - then create another list called 'Parking Lot', to help people feel their interests are being respected without holding up the group.

### Build a Hypothesis Together

This next step really depends on where the group is. If a problem statement has been made clearer by someone's prototype, then that's a great starting point.  

If you end up with 2 or 3 different hypothesis, these are also OK just ask your group to prioritize.
