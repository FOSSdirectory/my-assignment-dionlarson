This strategy for Human Centered Design focused on Participation is preceded by the workshop introduction. Please ensure you have followed the steps outlined before beginning here.

## Workshop

This version of the workshop give equal weight to individual and group collaboration.  We'll run approx half the d.school course as intended, and then as a group define the final prototype and next steps based on the first iteration of shared ideas.

### Reinforce Outcome

* Success is coming out of this understanding what the key problem is that I (or my team) want to solve for.
* Success is having some early prototypes and ideas we're interested in testing or adopting into existing processes and experiments.
* Success is having some consensus as a group on what we're trying to solve for, and understanding of context.
* A list of one or more action items, whatever those first steps towards experimentation might be.  

### Begin!

With the 'Focus Statement' clearly articulated, it's time to get started.  Ask people to pair up, if there is hesitation then pair people in the way you think most makes sense from your observations. Hand out the D-School worksheet(which you prepared in the preferred language prior to the workshop).

Following the directions on the [d.school design sheet](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Participant-Worksheet.pdf) execute this course until the completion of Step 7. **Run this course in it's entirety.**

### Build a Problem-Statement Together

Once you've finished the Design Thinking facilitation it's time to bring the group's ideas into center, and to iterate on a final prototype after discussion.

As a group ask those who feel they have prototypes to share to do so now.  Capture on a whiteboard or flip-chart (so people can direct) capture trends, and 'bucket' accordingly so you can identify patterns that are emerging in the group.

Ask key stakeholders, and others to weigh in on what they heard and together create a problem statement.  Set yourself no more than 10  minutes for this discussion.  

**Tip:**If people get off track, or insist on emphasis that's out of scope - then create another list called 'Parking Lot', to help people feel their interests are being respected without holding up the group.

### Build a Hypothesis Together

This next step really depends on where the group is. If a problem statement has been made clearer by someone's prototype, then that's a great starting point.  

If you end up with 2 or 3 different hypothesis, these are also OK just ask your group to prioritize.
