## Introductions!

If this is your first time running this workshop, or you appreciate a checklist for warming up and preparing your group, here is a suggested introductory workflow:

* **Introduce yourself**, and feel free to personalize the reasons why you are involved in leading workshops on Participation at Mozilla.  
* **Introduce Design Thinking as the methodology** we’ll be using to help guide the group’s goals for Participation.  If it helps, you can emphasize that human centered design is all about people an alignment with our own mission.  
* **Share your enthusiasm!** Encourage participants to embrace a fun, collaborative and creative experience!
* Introduce and briefly touch on the 5 components of Design Thinking:
**Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.**
* Be clear that this course **can help people look both define and **solve for problems problem in a new and innovative ways**, or help ideate on ideas they may already have.
* Provide scope: explain that you'll be woking in partners, materials and that some portions will be timed.  Comfort:  **there are no right answers, or perfection required**.

## Icebreaker 

This is an opportunity to gauge your group's strengths and where they need the most support, so YOU can decide which strategy & tools can best help them get there.

**Conduct a quick round of introductions and conversation on success and scope will help set and manage expectations.** 

* **If your group is < 15 people**, do a round of introductions (name, from), to share what Participation story brings them to the workshop.
* **If your group is > 15 and < 40**, do a round of introductions (name, from) and a Tweetable sentence that describes their Participation focus for this workshop.
* **If your group is > 40 people**, do a round of introductions (name, from) and one word that describes their feeling about being in the workshop today. 

## Agree on Participation Focus

As a result of the Icebreaker you can likely identify the type of group you're working with. Based on the suggestions below, identify the primary focus of the majority of people:

1. A group united around **a functional area perspective**. Described as a group of people who regularly work together on goals specific to a project.  
2. A group united around a **common Participation function**. Examples would be: 'code contributors or QA'.
3. A group united around a **contribution skill area**.  This would be Market Research, or Front End Development.
4. **The mixed bag**.  People with various backgrounds, interests and focus.
5. A group focused on any of the above where **participants are a good mix of staff and volunteers**.

It's likely you'll have some level of mixed participation, but use the majority  to define your group.  Voice your observation to the group, and have them agree with the assertion so you can move on to select your strategy.  

**Tip**: For those who may not identify with the main theme, assure them that they are in the exact right place to learn strategies and emerge with skills and ideas that can lend to their more dedicated focus.

## Select a Facilitation Strategy 

Currently there are three versions of this workshop, for the identified scenarios, but we grateful accept alternate versions, edits and pull requests on items to help improve facilitation of human centered design for Participation.

###For Focus #1, #2, #4
  [Design Thinking for Participation (Full d.school Course)]()

###For Focus #3
  [Design Thinking for Participation(Partial d.school Course & Group Focus)]()
  
###For Focus #5
  [Design Thinking for Participation(Community - Co-Design)]()

## Bring it home!

As a group pick one prototype/hypothesis (if you had more than one) you can agree fits this criteria:

1. Realistic & actionable in the near future.
2. Give strategic value to Mozilla.
3. Provide value to volunteers.


Transfer your learning and agreement using this format.  T

| Field      |    Meaning      |  
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Problem Statement: |
| Hypothesis: |
| Context      | Relevant Context, background and key facts 
| Success Criteria     | How would you judge a successful solution?    
| Stakeholders | Who are the contributors, potential community contacts, staff and users?     
| Scope/Constraints | Scope/constraints  

## Wrap Up

At this point, we tend have run out of time BUT if you do have time.  Go through your circle again, and ask people one thing they learned (could be a perspective of another person, or something about designing this way).
