#Objectives

>"At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.” - mozilla.org

Human Centered Design will facilitate conversations on Participation at Mozilla in a way that innovates for the success of people on the mission we care so much about. 

 With this in mind the objectives of this workshop are:

* Make 'empathy for people' the core of Participation design.
* Improve the capacity of staff and volunteers to **imagine, assess and put into practice ideas that push Mozilla’s mission forward through Participation**.
* Encourage ideation, **rapid prototyping** and ‘early sharing’ of ideas across roles, and into volunteer communities for feedback.
* Encourage a **‘bias towards action’**, experimenting, testing and sharing.
* Identify possible resources, activities and events in the broader organization where collaboration can be ongoing. (silo busting).
* Identify skills, knowledge and perspectives crucial to achieving the envisioned future.
* **Encourage self-reflection and accountability** of individual goals for Participation success. “Own what you do”.
* Help participants gain an awareness of possible, probable and desirable outcome for the **'big picture' of Participation at Mozilla**.
