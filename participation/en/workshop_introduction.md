- Adam Urbanski

## Workshop Introduction

This resource provides content, tools and facilitation techniques needed to run a **'Participation at Mozilla' Design Thinking Workshop**. This workshop will help teams and contributors create empathetic problem statements and strong hypothesis for solving those problems through rapid prototyping. This process will equip participants with a new set of skills resulting in better quality experiments and ultimately improved strategic success on Mozilla's mission and project goals. 

This workshop borrows heavily from [d-school's Crash Course in Design Thinking](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/) which is available under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC 3.0Licence). Working with human centered design guides our processes with empathy at the center of all we do. We believe that through collaboration, and by involving diverse perspectives while continually prototyping we move closer to better outcomes for Mozilla and volunteers.


The emphasis of this workshop is to increase the **participants awareness of the possible, probable and desirable futures for Participation**, to emerge with an attitude of 'prototyping in all we do' as well as an appreciation of key forces influencing the change we need.
