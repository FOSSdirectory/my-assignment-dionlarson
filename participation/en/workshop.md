# Workshop 

## Introductions!

If this is your first time running this workshop, you'll find this list of introduction material helpful.

* **Introduce yourself**, and feel free to personalize the reasons why you are involved in leading workshops on Participation at Mozilla.  
* **Introduce Design Thinking as the methodology** we’ll be using to help guide the group’s goals for Participation.  If it helps, you can emphasize that human centered design is all about people an alignment with our own mission.  
* Share your enthusiasm! **This will be a fun, collaborative and creative experience!**
* Introduce and touch on the 5 components of Design Thinking:
**Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.**
* Be clear that this course **can help people look both define and **solve for problems problem in a new and innovative ways**, or help ideate on ideas they may already have.
* Briefly describe the setup of partners, materials and that some portions will be timed.  Comfort:  **there are no right answers, or perfection required**.

## Icebreaker & Statement

The full Design Thinking Crash Course, might be overkill for your group.  **A quick round of introductions and conversation on success and scope will help set and manage expectations.** 

* **If your group is < 15 people**, do a round of introductions (name, from), and share one positive (less than 1 minute) volunteering experience.  To set the tone  go first, and keep your story short.
* **If your group is > 15 and < 25**, do a round of introductions (name, from) and a Tweetable sentence that describes why they believe Participation can help Mozilla punch above its weight.
* **If your group is > 25 people**, do a round of introductions (name, from) and one word that describes their feeling about being in the workshop today.
