This strategy for Human Centered Design focused on Participation is preceded by the workshop introduction. Please ensure you have followed the steps outlined before beginning here.

## Workshop

### Reinforce Outcome

* Success is coming out of this understanding what the key problem is that I (or my team) want to solve for.
* Success is having some early prototypes and ideas we're interested in testing or adopting into existing processes and experiments.
* A list of one or more action items, whatever those first steps towards experimentation might be.  

### Begin!

With the 'Focus Statement' clearly articulated, it's time to get started.  Ask people to pair up, if there is hesitation then pair people in the way you think most makes sense from your observations. Hand out the D-School worksheet(which you prepared in the preferred language prior to the workshop).

Following the directions on the [d.school design sheet](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Participant-Worksheet.pdf) to bring your group to a final problem statement and prototype. **Run this course in it's entirety.**
