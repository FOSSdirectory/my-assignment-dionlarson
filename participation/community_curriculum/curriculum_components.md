# Curriculum Components

![components](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7118/8160834324_94862c29db.jpg)

Components make up your educational offering, and are represented by files and folders as you saw in the technical requirements. 

### README.md

The README.md file contains basic information about your content, and content structure.  You can use [readme](https://github.com/emmairwin/community_curriculum/blob/master/participation/community_curriculum/templates/README.md) template.

### contribute.md  

Is an important way to engage contributors to your content, by explaining ways to get involved improving or submitting new content. You can use [this template](https://github.com/emmairwin/community_curriculum/blob/master/participation/community_curriculum/templates/contribution.md).

### Introduction.md

It's good to have an introduction.md file for both your main topic/functional area.   It's a good chance to share what your functional area/project are up to, who makes up the team and community, and perhaps how the skillset you are teaching is valuable to contributors and lends to Mozilla's mission. [Example](https://github.com/emmairwin/community_curriculum/blob/master/market_pulse/en/introduction.md)

Your topic area will also have an introduction.md file, which is a good chance to dig into the lesson or workshop outcomes, identify any pre-requisites, required resources and other details you think are relevant to inform.

You might also mention which [Web Literacies](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap) it covers. [Example](http://education.mozilla-community.org/modules/participation_design_thinking/workshop-introduction/).

#### Note on Qualities
![qualities](http://content.screencast.com/users/sunnydeveloper/folders/Jing/media/05525190-3dce-4876-a2e9-65a41c8dde3b/0000039`.png)
If you would like to add qualities to the introduction, as Marketpulse has, you can indicate that in the submission form. Later on I'll make this easier to do yourself.

### resources.md

Is simply a file external to your curriculum where you can provide links, and downloads needed without cluttering up your actual content.  [Here's a template](https://github.com/emmairwin/community_curriculum/blob/master/participation/community_curriculum/templates/resources.md).


### modulename.md  

Modules are logical chunks that make up your curriculum's learning objectives.  

* Here is a template for [module.md]() which can also be used for steps.

### participation_ladder.md

Steps are really just modules, but with specific goals n              related to Participation connection AND learning. A participation ladder describes the Participation pathway (the way the steps connect), the modules you create will provide the content. [Example breakdown of modules](https://github.com/emmairwin/community_curriculum/tree/master/participation/design_thinking_for_participation/en).

![ladder](http://content.screencast.com/users/sunnydeveloper/folders/Jing/media/c825eb52-b34d-4c14-a51a-5c5c743df536/00000398.png)

To articulate your ladder: 

1. [Read this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ag1VjlVe4-Pw7UP43tjM64gU_atBe501uU6_t6v0amU/edit#slide=id.p), and brainstorm what your steps are.
2. [Use this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POANDm-rUDmsjXCluxP1qoztZz_I3y8UXJGx8LVCfaw/edit) to document the steps for yourself.
3. Include your documented steps in the submission process. (as we don't yet have a template for you to create your own.


## Self Assessment

1. I understand the various components and their purpose.
2. I understand how to create participation ladders by giving thoughtful design to 'steps'.  (if you are interested in this scenario)
3. I understand how to break my content into modules.
