# Curriculum Components

![components](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7118/8160834324_94862c29db_b.jpg)

Components make up your educational offering, and are represented by files as you saw in the technical requirements.   

### Introduction.md

It's good to have an introduction.md file for both your main topic/functional area.   For main topic, it's a good chance to share what your functional area/project are up to, who makes up the team and community, and perhaps how the skillset you are teaching is valuable to contributors and lends to Mozilla's mission. 

You might also mention which [Web Literacies](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap) it covers.

Here is a template based on the [Marketpulse introduction](http://education.mozilla-community.org/modules/marketpulse/introduction/) you can remix for your area.

For your topic area it's a good chance to dig into the lesson or workshop outcomes, identify any pre-requisites, required resources and other details you think are relevant to inform.

#### *Note on Qualities
![qualities](http://content.screencast.com/users/sunnydeveloper/folders/Jing/media/05525190-3dce-4876-a2e9-65a41c8dde3b/00000396.png)
If you would like to add qualities to the introduction, as Marketpulse has, you can indicate that in the submission form. Later on I'll make this easier to do yourself.

### resources.md

Is simply a file external to your curriculum where you can provide links, and downloads needed without cluttering up your actual content.  [Here's a template]().

### participation_ladder.md

Steps modules, but with specific goals related to Participation AND learning. A participation ladder describes the Participation pathway, the modules you create will provide the content.

To articulate your ladder: 

1. [Read this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ag1VjlVe4-Pw7UP43tjM64gU_atBe501uU6_t6v0amU/edit#slide=id.p), and brainstorm what your steps are.
2. [Use this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POANDm-rUDmsjXCluxP1qoztZz_I3y8UXJGx8LVCfaw/edit) to document the steps for yourself.
3. Include your documented steps in the submission process. (as we don't yet have a template for you to create your own.


### modulename.md  

Modules are logical chunks that make up your curriculum's learning objectives. In the case of contribution scenario #2 these are 'steps'.  

* Here is a template for [module.md]() which can also be used for steps.

## Self Assessment

1. I understand the various components and their purpose.
2. I understand how to create participation ladders by giving thoughtful design to 'steps'.  (if you are interested in this scenerio)
3. I understand how to break my content into modules.
