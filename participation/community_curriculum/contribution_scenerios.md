This resource is written with an assumption that you are a person, team or volunteer with curriculum that can enable the success of contributors in their personal goals, and the goals of the project.  We also believe you should be able to identify with one of these three contribution scenarios: 

1. You have **curriculum targeted at specific skill-sets**  relevant to your functional area/project’s Participation needs.
2. You have **curriculum that aligns with a specific series of  Participation steps** and actions someone needs to take to advance their skill-set and depth of Participation at Mozilla. This scenario is also something you can grow ‘into’ from scenario #1, over time. 
3.You have **curriculum generally helpful** and transferable for functional area goals (i.e.: Social Media).

If you are unsure which suits your scenario, or you believe we’re missing one!  Please reach out.
