Standards provide us with a measure that encourages not only development of quality educational resources, but lends to a predictable navigation for learners, and easier maintenance and contribution.

You will need a Github user account. It's easy to [sign-up](https://github.com/join).

## Technical Specifications

*Disclaimer: Don't worry if technical elements feel overwhelming, there are supports in place to help you along the way.  We know you are learning too!*

All curriculum is hosted in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/emmairwin/community_curriculum), the [Education Portal code exists separately](https://github.com/emmairwin/community_curriculum) and 'pulls in' curriculum. This provides a modular way for others to fork/remix and share curriculum other purposes across Mozilla, without the need to understand code. It also means we can switch platforms for displaying curriculum without too much effort.

## Curriculum File Format


All curriculum is written in Markdown (filename.md), and separated according the the file structure below. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) is super-easy to write. [There are many awesome editors](http://whatismarkdown.com/). I use [this one for Mac](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).

**If this feels like a barrier to your work, we will take submissions written in Google Docs (and weâ€™ll convert to Markdown for you). We encourage you however** 


# Curriculum Directory Structure


The directory structure for scenario #1 & 2 is the same.  Top level is 'Main Focus/Project/Functional Area' with all content related to that topic at same level (introduction, contribute.md).

Below top-level, is one or more folders representing topics can exist organized by language (en = English).  We'll get describe each of the files, and provide templates a bit later on.

## Naming Conventions

File names should be all lowercase, and clear to outcome topics( so we can make easy guesses about purpose by looking at files).  Use .md for Markdown files, and separate words by underscores.  i.e.:  my_topic.md

# Self Assessment

1. I can name the file format used for curriculum files including filename extension. I understand there are special editors that make editing curriculum super-easy.
2. If I'm not comfortable with the format standard, I know the alternative ways I can submit content.
3. I understand the file structure, even if I'm not quite sure how it relates to my content yet.
4. I understand naming conventions (how you name files).
