## Learning by Participating

Empowering community Participation through education and training opportunities provides a [virtuous circle](https://commonspace.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_20150126_1347512.jpg?w=480&h=314) between our contributors, their personal, goals and the goals of the project. It’s also a fun opportunity to test ideas, get feedback and connect learning-by-doing opportunities with contribution to Mozilla’s mission.

We're thrilled that you are interested in contributing curriculum to the Community Education Portal. Below you’ll find the information you need, including standards which help us organize content in a way that makes the site easy to navigate, and scale.  This is a work in progress, please do provide feedback on ways to improve this process for you in future.

In the next few modules we'll take you through the curriculum standards, and process for contributing curriculum.
