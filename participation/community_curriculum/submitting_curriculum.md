# Submitting Curriculum

So you've come far!  You have some basic knowledge of the curriculum structure, the technical background and the components that are needed to complete a submission.  Lets wrap this up with the steps needed to submit your curriculum.

If you are comfortable with Github you can submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) of your content to the [curriculum repo](https://github.com/emmairwin/community_curriculum) without any additional information.   If you prefer to submit your content through [this form](), and we will submit the pull request on  your behalf.  This is where we will provide feedback, and inform you of decisions regarding your submission.

Here are some things to expect from here.

## Review Process


There are three criteria we will evaluate criteria for:

1. **Content Appropriateness**:  Does this content teach a skill related to Participation at Mozilla, or is it more of a ‘how to’ contribute.  The later belongs on a wiki.

2. **Content Standard**:  Have you followed our templates for modules, provided self-assessment opportunities among other recommendations.
 
3. **Content Quality**:   Is the curriculum well-written, easy to understand and navigate, is it clear what someone can learn and do as a result. 

Based on the review  you’ll see one of two things happen: your submission will be accepted and slated for publishing to the Portal, or we’ll start a conversation thread on Github for suggested changes and questions (if we don’t understand).  

**If there are a lot of errors in format, content and structure then we will refer you back to this document before moving forward again.**

## Launching


Once your curriculum has been approved, you will receive an update in the Github Issue and in an email notifying you of the launch date.  An update with community will be shared on community lists/forums and via the [@MozParticipate Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MozParticipate/).

## Post - Launch

* Ensure your contribute.md is up to date with paths to your issue-tracker, and ways to help test content, and participate.

## Maintenance

If you want to make changes to your account, there are a number of ways to accomplish that.  The first is to make the change yourself and submit it as a pull request, the second is to create an issue so that we, or someone in the community can make that change for you.  If you need to make significant changes or structural modifications, then an email to me can start the conversation and problem-solve the next steps

## Localization

The file structure allows for localization of content, and we will encourage localization of content.  I haven’t got a solution currently for displaying localized content on the platform, but we hope to in the near future.
